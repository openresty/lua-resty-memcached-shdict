Synopsis

```lua
local shdict_memc = require "resty.memcached.shdict"

local function dlog(ctx, ...)
    ngx.log(ngx.DEBUG, "my app: ", ...)
end

local function error_log(ctx, ...)
    ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "my app: ", ...)
end

local function warn(ctx, ...)
    ngx.log(ngx.WARN, "my app: ", ...)
end

local memc_fetch, memc_store =
    shdict_memc.gen_memc_methods{
        tag = "my memcached server tag",
        debug_logger = dlog,
        warn_logger = warn,
        error_logger = error_log,

        locks_shdict_name = "some_lua_shared_dict_name",

        shdict_set = meta_shdict_set,  -- generated by lua-resty-shdict-simple or
                                       -- any other API compatible function factories

        shdict_get = meta_shdict_get,  -- ditto

        disable_shdict = false,  -- optional, default false

        memc_host = "127.0.0.1",
        memc_port = 11211,
        memc_timeout = 200,  -- in ms
        memc_conn_pool_size = 5,
        memc_fetch_retries = 2,  -- optional, default 1
        memc_fetch_retry_delay = 100, -- in ms, optional, default to 100 (ms)

        memc_conn_max_idle_time = 10 * 1000,  -- in ms, for in-pool connections,
                                              -- optional, default to nil

        memc_store_retries = 2,  -- optional, default to 1
        memc_store_retry_delay = 100,  -- in ms, optional, default to 100 (ms)

        store_ttl = 1,  -- in second, optional, default to 0 (i.e., never expires)
    }

-- on hot code paths:

local ctx = ngx.ctx

-- in case of failure, can return the stale data with an error message
local data, err = memc_fetch(ctx, key)

-- using the default ttl specified by "store_ttl"
local ok = memc_store(ctx, key, value)

ok = memc_store(ctx, key, value, ttl)  -- overriding the default ttl
```

Description
===========

This library provides a powerful memcached client that deliver the following important features:

1. Automatically using shm-based caching layer with OpenResty's [lua_shared_dict](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_shared_dict).
This local shm cache layer can also be turned off by setting the `disable_shdict` to `true`.
1. Automatically using server-level (not worker-level) cache locks (based on
[lua-resty-lock](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-lock)) to avoid duplicate and concurrent
queries to the memcached server for the same key when it is a cache miss in the local shm cache.
1. Automatically handles and logs any errors while accessing the Memcached server or `lua_shared_dict`.
1. Automatically uses connection pools for all the Memcached queries.
1. Automatically returns stale (or expired) data item in the local shm cache when a cache miss happens
*and* some other light threads are already querying Memcached and updating the cache for the same key.
1. Automatically retry querying Memcached when failures happen (like intermittent network issues).

This library is mostly used for cases that use Memcached or Memcached-compatible servers as the
data storage (like Kyoto Tycoon).

Atop this library, the user can further add another per-worker caching layer by employing the
[lua-resty-lrucache](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-lrucache)
library herself, and/or add asynchronous cache updating mechanism via [ngx.timer.at](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxtimerat).

Caveats
=======

* Unlike the [lua-resty-memcached](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-memcached) library,
this client does not escape special characters in the key by default. So it is the caller's responsibility
to avoid using special characters in the keys.
